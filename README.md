Hey there 👋 I'm George. I'm an aspiring web developer currently job seeking while living and working in Dublin, California.

I enjoy playing PC games, reading web novels, watching YouTube videos, and playing the violin when inspired.

## Stuff I'm doing
* Job hunting for a web application development role
* Starting a [blog](https://dev.to/geyokoyama) in an attempt to create the habit of writing regularly
* Converting my neovim configuration written in vimscript into lua

## Stuff I want to do someday
* Go on a food tour around the world 🍖
* Learn to cook authentic Japanese food 🍱
* Read 50 books in a year 📖

## Three Favorites
* My favorite game series so far is Dark Souls 💀
* Books would be the Lord of the Rings Trilogy 📚
* And food would be noodles, a tie between ramen🍜 and pasta 🍝
